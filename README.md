# 3D_Design

Hi, my name is Sasha Berthet and I'm an applied physics student. 

I've always loved designing and creating things ever since I was a kid. I've spent hundreds of hours playing with Lego and Kapla to invent stuff. Naturally, this attraction to design has only grown, until now. 
I've been lucky enough to do several internships during my studies and to put this passion for design into practice. 

I'd like to share some of my work with you here. 

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me. 

See you soon on GitHub ;)
