# The Engine

Engines hold a prominent place in the global technological landscape. Their operation relies on the conversion of one form of energy into mechanical motion, an engineering feat that powers a wide range of industrial, commercial, and domestic applications.

The diversity of engines is as vast as their applications. From internal combustion engines, ubiquitous in automotive vehicles, to electric motors, hybrid engines, and even ion thrusters used in space exploration, each type of engine offers unique advantages in terms of power, efficiency, and durability.

At the heart of their operation lie fundamental principles of physics and mechanics. Whether converting chemical energy into rotational motion in the case of internal combustion engines, or transforming electrical energy into mechanical force in the case of electric motors, these devices exploit complex processes to generate useful work.

# Project context

In my quest to comprehend the complex mechanisms driving our world, I undertook a personal project with the aim of uncovering the mysteries of engine functionality. This endeavor propelled me into the depths of engineering and design, resulting in the meticulous creation of a 3D engine block. Specifically, I focused on a four-cylinder gasoline-fueled internal combustion cycle with an electrical ignition source, crafted using SolidWorks.

# Design

I didn't know exactly where to start, so I decided to keep things simple first and then add the engine components brick by brick. To do this, I started by creating the connecting rod-piston-crankshaft assembly to observe a first motion.

I soon faced a problem: what are the orders of magnitude of all these components? So I did a bit of research. I found that a connecting rod is usually between 15 and 30 cm long. That would be my base. So I started by creating a connecting rod of about 30 cm.

I was surprised to learn that what we call a connecting rod is actually an assembly of several components, such as the connecting rod, rod bolt, rod cap, rod nut and rod bearing insert. Then I get back to work and desing all this part.
