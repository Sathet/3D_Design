# European Synchrotron Radiation Facility

This project is part of my first internship in 2023 at the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) a particle accelerator located in Grenoble, France.

The ESRF is one of the world's most advanced research centers in the fields of materials science and structural biology. It houses a high-energy particle accelerator that generates intense synchrotron radiation (X-ray due to Bremsstrahlung braking radiation). It differ from Collider such as the CERN in Geneva where 2 particles are accelerated to bump into each other.

This radiation is utilized by researchers worldwide to study the structure and properties of materials at the atomic and molecular scale. Work conducted at the ESRF has applications in numerous fields including medicine, pharmacology, materials physics, chemistry, and biology, contributing to significant scientific advancements and technological innovations.

# Project context

Some samples are studied at high pressure and high temperature for various purposes (phase diagram, etc.). It is therefore essential to have precise knowledge of these two characteristics of the sample, and we need instruments to measure them. The aim of this project was to develop a new instrument called PRL (Pressure Ruby Luminescence) to measure pressure.

This is a very interesting instrument that uses properties of ruby and a bunch of optics to work.

## Theory

>Ruby is chromium-doped corundum (Al2O3). The Cr3+ in corundum's lattice forms an octahedra with surrounding oxygen ions. The octahedral crystal field together with spin-orbital interaction results in different energy levels. Once 3d electrons in Cr3+ are energized by lasers, the excited electrons would go to 4T2 and 2T2 levels. Later they return to 2E levels and the R1, R2 lines come from luminescence from 2E levels to 4A2 ground level.[2] The energy difference of 2E levels are 29 cm−1, corresponding to the splitting of R1, R2 lines at 1.39 nm.

To sum up the paragraph above, ruby excited by laser generate visible light, thanks to energy level transitions that produce visible light chromium ions in corundum (Al2O3) give rise to . Which is
